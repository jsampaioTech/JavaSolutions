- The main method is in the MainController class 

- Running the java application, a simple text scanner is launched in the terminal. 
	- In the first hand it's displayed the two options to select. The first option the Sorting Balls and the second the Spells It Out exercise, to select is just necessary press the key 1 or 2 respectively. 
	- Just follow the printed messages to insert the inputs (numbers)
	- SORTING BALLS - INVALID INPUT - means duplicated ball or invalid number ball (valid number between 0 and 59)
	- SPELLS IT OUT - INVALID INPUT - means invalid number (valid number between 0 and 1 000 000 000)
	- To Exit of the terminal just press the keys 'e' and enter

- Sorting Balls Source Code Options 
		- To sort the list of balls, I choose to use the quicksort algorithm because in the notes says to avoid the java.util library.
	In this case I would use List or LinkedList for easier development.
